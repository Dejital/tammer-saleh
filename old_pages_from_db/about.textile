h1. About Me

I'm an experienced developer living in San Francisco, and working as an independent Agile and Ruby on Rails consultant.  

I wrote the "Shoulda":http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda testing framework, which at last count was in use by about 15% of the Ruby community.   I was also the primary developer and project manager for Thoughtbot's fantastic "Hoptoad service":http://hoptoadapp.com, and am currently co-authoring Addison Wesley's "Rails AntiPatterns":http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780321620293 with "Chad Pytel":http://thoughtbot.com/about/people#cpytel.

I've also "spoken extensively":/pages/speaking at various Ruby and Rails conferences.

In previous lives I've done AI programming for the NCSA and the University of Illinois, and systems administration for Citysearch.com and Caltechâ€™s Earthquake Detection Network.
