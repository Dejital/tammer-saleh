h1. Book Review: Troubleshooting Ruby Processes by Philippe Hanrigou

Addison-Wesley has been releasing a number of Ruby and Rails books under the editorship of Obie Fernandez.  I got my hands on ""Troubleshooting Ruby Processes":http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321544684&rl=1" by "Philippe Hanrigou":http://www.informit.com/authors/author_bio.aspx?ISBN=0321544684, and I have to say that I was very impressed with the material presented.
