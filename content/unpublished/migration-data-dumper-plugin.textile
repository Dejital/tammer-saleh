h1. Migration data dumper plugin

__(Note: this entry was reposted from my last blog)__

So you're playing around with your latest project which uses these brand spanky new migration thingies.  You're so edgy!  You run 

<pre>
rake migrate VERSION=0
rake migrate
</pre>

to make sure all your migrations are in proper order, and _"Oh, Snap!"_,  all your data went ka-poof!

Sucks, donut?  Well, I'm here to help.
