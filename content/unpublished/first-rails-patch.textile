h1. First rails patch!

A "co-worker":http://workingwithrails.com/person/1556-jon-yurek and I over at "thoughtbot":http://www.thoughtbot.com are working on an application that makes heavy use of the newish REST resources.  While @map.resources@ is hella beautiful and a serious code-saver, we found that a small addition would make it even more so.
