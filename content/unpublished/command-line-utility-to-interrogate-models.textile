h1. Command line utility to interrogate models

I've started working at a "really great company":http://www.thoughtbot.com recently (a little ass kissing never hurts), and one of the projects I'm working on has some pretty hairy interrelated models on the back end.  

As both an exercise in meta-programming, and to help me get a handle on the code I'm working with, I've written a little command line script that dumps all kinds of information about a model (or about the general hierarchy of all the models).
